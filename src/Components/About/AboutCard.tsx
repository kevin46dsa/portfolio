      <h3>Hello My Name Is Kevin</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a <strong>FullStack Developer</strong> with over 4+ years of
        experience building scalable, user-focused web applications. I also
        recently earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Stevens
        Institute of Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about turning ideas into intuitive, high-performing
        software. Whether I’m architecting backend systems, or collaborating in
        agile teams, I strive to create solutions that are both elegant and
        impactful.
